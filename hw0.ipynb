    "After your yearly checkup, the doctor has bad news and good news. The\n",
    "bad news is that you tested positive for a very serious cancer and\n",
    "that the test is 99% accurate i.e. the probability of testing\n",
    "positive given you have the disease is 0.99. The probability of\n",
    "testing negative if you donâ€™t have the disease is the same. The good news is that it is a very rare condition affecting only 1 in 10,000 people. What is the probability you actually have the disease? (Show all calculations and the final result.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Answer\n",
    "Denoting P(A): probability of carrying the disease, P(B): probability of testing positive for the disease, P(A|B): probability of carrying the disease if testing positive for it. Furthermore, we denote the latter's reciprocal P(B|A): probability of testing positive if one is carrying the disease. We want to use these in Bayes Theorem:\n",
    "\n",

    "P(A|B) = \\frac{P(A)P(B|A)}{P(B)}\n",

    "but we only have values for two of the three variables in the right hand side of this equation: $P(A) = 1/10000 = 0.0001$ and $P(B|A) = 0.99$. The former comes from the population statistics of the disease and the latter is the accuracy of the test for true positives. But we still need a value for $P(B)$. We can get it by summing up all the different ways of B occuring. B can happen through to ways, A occuring or A not occuring (the complement of A, denoted $A'$), both with their respective probability. In mathematical terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|A')P(A')\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "P(B|A) we know to be 0.99. P(A) is still 0.0001. P(B|A') is the probability of a false postive, given implicitly in the problem statement as 1 - 0.99 = 0.1. Finally P(A') is the prior probability of not carrying the disease and it's value is 1 - 1/10000 = 0.9999. Plugging these values into the equation for P(B), we get:\n",
    "\n",

    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this in Bayes Theorem (first equation in this section, sorry about the equation numbering not working) we get a value for $P(A|B) \\approx 0.0098$, or in words just shy of 1% risk of having the disease given a positive test.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Answer\n",
    "For a uniformly distributed stochastic variable on an interval [a, b], the epected value is equal to $(a+b)/2$, so we get $E[X] = (1+(-1))/2 = 0$. Since $Y$ is determined by $X$, we can simplify the sought-after value $\\mbox{cov}(X, Y )$ as $\\mbox{cov}(X, X ^2 )$. We use the definition of the covariance $\\mbox{cov}(X, Y) = E[(X - E[Y])(Y - E[X])]$. We combine these two expressions to get:\n",
